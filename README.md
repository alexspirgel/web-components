# Web Components
An attempt to create a suitable web components system for use in large projects.

## Notes
* Compile modules via webpack.
	- Handle default vs. override file choice here.
	- Output to module dist folder.
* Main module script.
	- `index.js` in module root.
	- Is not part of webpack compilation.
	- Using ES6 import:
		- Import compiled script from dist folder.
		- Import nested components.
		- Import any other run-time dependencies.

## Figuring It Out
Ideally we want to be able to `npm install` a module and automatically get it's dependencies, versioning causes problems though. Because of how node installs modules, if 2 components require different versions of another component, we cannot be certain of the location of a specific version of that module (https://medium.com/learnwithrahul/understanding-npm-dependency-resolution-84a24180901b). This clashes with the ES6 import setup.

Potential solution:
Set all component dependencies as any version `"my_component": "x"`. Each component will have `v1.x`, `v2.x`, etc. that the module lives within.  

Do we want these components to live in the `node_modules` folder? Wouldn't it be nice if all the modules were in their own `components` folder, but all their non-module dependencies still lived in `node_modules`? It would feel weird doing most of the work on a website editing code within the `node_modules` folder.

Do updates to a node module remove other files (custom overrides) in that folder even if they are npm ignored?
